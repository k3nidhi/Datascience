# SKILLCRAFT TASKS ->  Datascience

This repository contains solutions for various data analysis and machine learning tasks. Each task demonstrates a different aspect of data science, including data visualization, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Task Descriptions and Solutions

### Task 01: Data Visualization
- **Objective**: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
- **Example**: Visualize the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
- **Solution**: In this task, we use libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visually appealing and informative plots to better understand data distribution.

### Task 02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
- **Exploration Goals**: Analyze the relationships between variables, detect any missing values, and identify patterns and trends in the data.
- **Solution**: This task involves handling missing values, analyzing variable correlations, and using visualizations to discover insights.

### Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Objective**: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.
- **Dataset**: Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Solution**: In this task, we preprocess data, split it into training and testing sets, and use a decision tree classifier to make predictions. We also evaluate model accuracy to understand performance.

### Task 04: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- **Analysis Goals**: Identify accident hotspots and contributing factors.
- **Solution**: We analyze accident data, visualize accident hotspots on a map, and use statistical techniques to identify significant patterns based on road conditions and other variables.
